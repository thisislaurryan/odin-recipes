            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                <li>1.5 cups whole milk, divided</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>0.24 cups instant espresso</li>
                <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>0.25 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>

                <h3><strong>Important:</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Make sure to freeze your ice cream maker base overnight prior to making this recipe!</strong></p>
            </section>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, slowly whisk the cornstarch into 1 cup cold whole milk, then whisk in the sugar and instant espresso. Apply medium heat and heat for 4 to 6 minutes, whisking frequently, until nearly simmering and the mixture thickens.</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat. Stir in the remaining 0.5 cups whole milk, heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>Transfer the mixture to a large metal or glass bowl. Place the bowl in a smaller bowl of ice water for 1 hour, making sure not to splash any water into the ice cream. Alternatively, simply place the bowl in the refrigerator and wait for 3 to 4 hours or until the temperature drops to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                <li>Churn according to your ice cream maker instructions, about 25 minutes for soft serve consistency.</li>
                <li>Transfer the churned ice cream into a loaf pan or storage container. Place the container in the freezer and freeze for at least 2 hours (or overnight), which “ripens” the ice cream and creates the hard ice cream texture. Store in a loaf pan with a parchment sheet over the top or a sealed container in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.</li>
